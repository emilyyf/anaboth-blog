So uhm, I am basically that lesbian witch aunt that would give you a bong as a gift for your 16th anniversary.

I am always listening to music. And even though I listen to every genre, I tend to stick more to metalcore. During free time I enjoy playing competitive games, I played CS:GO competitively, and grind in an MMO.

Recently I have been learning more and more about politics and have found again my desire to write. It’s been years since I’ve stopped writing, so expect everything here to be trash :3
